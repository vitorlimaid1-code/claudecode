# Bundled ICC profiles — origin and redistribution terms

All three files are copied unmodified from `@imgly/plugin-print-ready-pdfs-web@1.82.0/dist/`,
which already redistributes them. None may be altered; none may be sold separately.

The HEIDELBERG licence requires the profile to be distributed together with its
licence text, so this file must ship in every artefact that contains the profile.
